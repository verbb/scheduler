# Installation & Setup
You can install Scheduler via the plugin store, or through Composer.

## Craft Plugin Store
To install **Scheduler**, navigate to the _Plugin Store_ section of your Craft control panel, search for `Scheduler`, and click the _Try_ button.

## Composer
You can also add the package to your project using Composer and the command line.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:
```shell
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Then tell Composer to require the plugin, and Craft to install it:

composer require verbb/scheduler && php craft plugin/install scheduler
```
